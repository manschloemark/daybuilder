Day Builder
-----------
Day Builder is a simple daily planning program I made for myself.
This program is focused on the importance of making concrete plans
each day, saving your future self the time and energy required to
make decisions in the moment.
It also lets you quickly review your history and shows statistics
that can help you find ways to improve your day.

Written in Python 3.8
Dependencies: PyQt5, numpy, pandas

This is still a work in progress and I will update the readme in the future.
